👋 Dear reader, I am Henry M. Ceresetti!

👀 I am interested on web systems development (both frontend and backend parts) and some things about software development (mainly free and open source projects).

🌱 I am currently learning TypeScript web programming language allied with Angular web framework on frontend and Java Plataform based on Enterprise Edition on backend counterpart.

💞️ I am looking to collaborate on retrogaming projects.

📫 How you can contact me: check my social network accounts on my GitHub public developer webpage, then you can send a message on a private chat to any of them.

Thank you for taking your time to read this file!

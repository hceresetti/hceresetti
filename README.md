👋 Dear reader, I am Henry M. Ceresetti!

👀 I am interested on web systems development (both frontend and backend parts) and some things about software development (mainly free and open source projects).

🌱 I am currently learning TypeScript web programming language allied with Angular web framework on frontend and Java Plataform based on Enterprise Edition on backend counterpart.

💞️ I am looking to collaborate on retrogaming projects.

📫 How you can contact me: create a new private chat willing to send a message to my LinkedIn personal profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/henryceresetti/

👋 Dear reader, I am Henry Ceresetti!

👀 I am interested in remote systems development (both frontend and backend portions) and some stuff related to software development, mainly free and open source projects.

🌱 I am currently learning TypeScript web programming language allied with Angular web framework on frontend and Java Plataform based on Enterprise Edition associated with backend counterpart.

💞️ I am looking to collaborate on retrogaming projects.

📫 How you can contact me: check my social network accounts on my GitHub public developer webpage, then you can send a message on a private chat to any of them.

Thank you for taking your time to read this file!
